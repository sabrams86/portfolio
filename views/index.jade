    div.about
      p I used to be an engineer.  One day I found myself wanting to help my company re-organize their data by implementing a new database system.  After some research and advice from a friend, I decided to try to implement a web based database using Ruby on Rails.
      p I spent all of my free time on nights and weekends learning the basics and going through all sorts of tutorials I finally was able to successfully build the 
        a(href='https://github.com/sabrams86/engdb' target='_blank') database 
        | and deploy it locally on the company's network.  Over the next year I realized that my favorite thing I had ever worked on (professionally or academically) was building the database.
      p A friend told me about 
        a(href='http://www.galvanize.com/' target='_blank') Galvanize 
        | and said I should check out their 24 week Full Stack program.  I decided that the timing was right, so I applied, was accepted and am graduating from the full stack program in October 2015 at which point I will be trained for Junior to Mid-level full stack jobs using MEAN (MongoDB, Expressjs, Angular, Nginx) and Rails (PosgreSQL, Rails, React, Apache) stacks.
      p I absolutely love the tech scene and try my best to keep of with the hottest trends, gadgets, and happenings in the tech community.  I frequent the Denver Ruby and Node.js meetups, as well as participating in other Galvanize and tech community events.
